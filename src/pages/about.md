DBpedia is a collaborative initiative aimed at extracting structured information from Wikipedia and presenting it as Linked Open Data. While DBpedia has dedicated chapters for resource-rich languages like English and German, there is a noticeable gap in representation for low-resourced languages such as Hindi.

This project seeks to expand the Hindi DBpedia Chapter. Our objective is to enhance the existing extractor framework for Hindi, enabling the extraction of knowledge graphs from Hindi Wikipedia. The resulting knowledge graph will be made queryable and accessible to end users through a web interface.
